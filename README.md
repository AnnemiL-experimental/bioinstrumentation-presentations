# Bioinstrumentation Presentations

This repository contains two PowerPoint presentations created by **Siyi Li** for the course **CPB 328: Bioinstrumentation** at Miami University. These materials provide a concise yet informative overview of key biomedical engineering topics including **biopotentials** and **biomedical sensors**.

## Files

### Biopotential.pptx
Covers the origin, types, and characteristics of electrical signals generated by excitable biological tissues, including:
- **ECG (Electrocardiography)**
- **EMG (Electromyography)**
- **EEG (Electroencephalography)**
- **ENG (Electroneurography)**
- **ERG (Electroretinography)**
- Non-biopotential imaging techniques (CT, Echocardiogram)

### Biosensor.pptx
Explores the principles, characteristics, and applications of various biomedical sensors:
- **Capacitive Sensors**
- **Piezoelectric Sensors**
- **Quantum Sensors**
- **Infrared Thermometer Sensors**
- **Optical Sensors**
- **Radiation Thermometry**

Includes definitions and discussions of key terms:
- Sensitivity
- Linearity
- Precision
- Accuracy
- Offset

## Purpose
These presentations were developed as course deliverables and are shared for educational and reference purposes. They may be useful to students, educators, or anyone interested in foundational biomedical sensor technologies and signal acquisition.
